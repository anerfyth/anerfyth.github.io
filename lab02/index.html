   <p><b>Almaty</b> is a city of republican significance and the largest settlement in <b>the Republic of Kazakhstan</b>. It had been the capital of Kazakhstan for almost 70 years. Today Almaty is called the <i>“southern capital”</i> because, in terms of the intensity of economic, social, and cultural life, it is really a capital city.</p>
   <p>Located in southeast Kazakhstan at the foot of <b>the Zailiyskiy Alatau</b> branch of <b>the Tian Shan Mountains</b>, the city is naturally divided into upper and lower sections. There is a joke that every citizen of Almaty can travel to any city in the world and divide it into <i>“upper and lower”</i>, and there is some truth to this claim.</p>
