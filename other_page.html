   <p>Nestled between Europe and Asia, Almaty is Kazakhstan’s largest city that is both literally and culturally rich. The city first came to global prominence as one of the many stops on The Silk Road, as merchants crossed countries and continents to trade. Almaty is known as <b><i>the “Golden Triangle”</i></b> in Kazakhstan for its trio of major natural attractions:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>the Kolsai Lakes,</li>
    <li>Charyn Canyon,</li>
    <li>and Altyn-Emel National Park.</li>
   </ul>
